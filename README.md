# SecurityScanners
This scanner performs tests on XSS whit different GET params, which have same names as variables in JS on the page. I hope, that this scanner can help to reveal security misconfiguration in the interlayer between backend and frontend, which sometimes can interact with client JS (e.g. by inserting some parametrs directly into the script)
